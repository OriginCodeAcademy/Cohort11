# Very Simple Todo App

In this project you are going to build a sophisticated Todo app using AngularJS that allows users to enter their todo items and prioritize them based on their importance.

The app will then allow users to sort their todo items based on the priority, or by alphabetical order.

## Tasks
1. Create a folder named `VSTDA` in your `dev` folder.
2. Setup your Git workflow.
  - Initialize an empty git repository in `VSTDA` by running `git init` in the command prompt.
  - Create a repository on GitHub called `VSTDA` and follow the instructions to add a remote origin.
3. Open this folder in your favorite text editor.
4. Create an `index.html` file with the gulp-inject comments needed to inject the script and link tags for your application dependencies and custom html, js and css. Add gulpfile.js, package.json and bower.json and the needed directory structure to support auto-reload and script injection during local development. Add a .gitignore file to the root directory to exclude the `bower_components and node_modules` folders from version control.
5. Design your HTML page using the Bootstrap design framework. The attached screenshots are design suggestions but you are free to be creative with the final look and feel of the project.
6. Make use of the following AngularJS features to build this application.
	- Two way data binding using the `ng-model` directive and one way data binding using the Angular markup `{{}}` bindings or the `ng-bind` attribute in a span tag.
	- Click event binding using the `ng-click` directive.
	- Dynamic CSS using the `ng-class` directive.
	- Iteration using the `ng-repeat` directive.
	- Filtering using Angular Filters. (Research what these are first!)
