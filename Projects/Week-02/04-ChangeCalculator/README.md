# Change Calculator

At the last minute, you've been asked to work on team developing a module for an automated check-out system of a nationally-based grocery store chain. The module your team is building will accept two inputs: the total amount of the sale and the amount tendered by the customer. Then, it should calculate the amount of change due in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

This should give you a visual idea of what is required. Since it is just a prototype mockup, you are free to modify the layout and styles as you see fit. You probably will want to add a Calculate button as well.
