# Day 1 - Welcome to Origin!

First of all - welcome to Origin Code Academy and congratulations for taking an amazing first step toward a successful career in Software Development!

Today will not be heavy on learning new coding topics, instead we will be focusing on one of the most crucial components of being a happy and successful software developer..

> Make yourself a comfortable place to work.

Today is about ensuring that you are prepared for the next 12 weeks of learning. The goal is to remove as much friction as possible so that you can focus on the course instead of any obstacles that could have been avoided day one.

### Hardware Setup
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

You will be spending a lot of time working on the computer in the next 12 weeks, and it's important that you spend that time as productively as possible. Slow computers mean slow learning, so this is a great opportunity to gain back valuable hours in the day that would otherwise be spent waiting for your computer to catch up with you.

The best thing you can do to speed up your computer is to buy and install a Solid State Drive (or SSD) to replace the existing Hard Disk Drive (or HDD) in your computer. For a rundown of the difference between the two and why an SSD provides such a dramatic performance boost - check out the following article. https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hdd-versus-ssd-whats-the-diff/

### Software Setup
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Make sure you have signed up for all the necessary accounts and installed the necessary software to complete the course. You may have already completed this step when you were given a link to our [Syllabus](https://github.com/origincodeacademy/syllabus) repository - double check again, as there have been a couple of additions that have been added recently.

#### Signup for these Accounts
* [ ] [GitHub](https://www.github.com) - You will use this to store your source code online and get feedback from your instructor. You'll almost certainly end up using this for the rest of your career in software development as well.
* [ ] [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) - This is how almost all recruiters will find you when you start looking for jobs. Don't worry too much about filling in every field for now, our careers team will help you fine tune this later in the course.

#### Install these applications

*Required for Week 1-4*
* [ ] [Atom](https://atom.io/) - You will use this to edit HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
* [ ] [Resilio](https://www.getsync.com/) - (Previously named BitTorrent Sync) Every session will be recorded and uploaded to a shared Resilio folder.
* [ ] [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - This is the primary browser we will be using for web development. It is currently the most popular browser, and also has a fantastic set of development tools to help you debug your web applications.
* [ ] [Postman (Chrome Extension)](https://www.getpostman.com/) - A tool we will be using to test out APIs that we create later in the course.
* [ ] [Git command line utility](https://www.git-scm.com) - You will use this in command prompt to communicate with GitHub.
* [ ] [NodeJS (LTS)](https://www.nodejs.org/) NodeJS is the swiss army knife of the development world.

#### Atom Package Recommends

2. HTML/CSS/JS Prettify - this package can be installed using package control. It will properly indent your code and can be set to fire whenever you save your code.

3. Emmett - HTML keyboard shortcuts - install using package control

4. Popular Themes - Material, Brogrammer
