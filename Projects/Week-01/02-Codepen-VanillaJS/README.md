# CodePen Exercises - VanillaJS

The goal of these exercises are to be small and accomplishable enough so that you can complete several of these to pick up core concepts relevant to the larger projects.

These exercises focus on small features written using nothing but JavaScript - no frameworks, no libraries, just you and the `document` object.

## Instructions
First of all, go [create an account at CodePen.io](https://www.codepen.io).

Complete each of the CodePen exercises listed below. When you navigate to each link, a copy of the exercise will be saved as a Pen in your Account.
