## Welcome to Origin Code Academy

This repository contains the resources you'll need while taking this course.

New projects will be added daily to the `Projects` folder to be completed by it's given due date. Each project contains a readme file with the requirements for that project, along with materials that you will need to complete it.


## What to do when you get stuck

It's normal to get stuck while working on assignments. How to get unstuck is one of the most important skills you can learn as a software developer.

Here is a suggested happy path when you are stuck.

- Try to research the problem first. Take a break from coding and spend time researching your problem in the following places:
	- Documentation: Try to find the documentation for the technology you are using, such as the [Angular docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api) for Angular and the [MSDN documentation library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx) for C#/.NET.
	- Google: The shotgun approach - practice your Google-Fu. For errors, try pasting the exact error into Google. You'll usually find blog posts/stack overflow answers as a result. Go for the most recent (within the 2-3 years) first!
	- StackOverflow: Its likely that someone else has had the same problem as you, and had it resolved thanks to the community at Stack Overflow. Look first for the green checkmark beside the accepted responses. Its also recommended that you join Stack Overflow so that you can post your own questions and solutions to the community. This also will help build your presence within the on-line developer community and give a hiring manager something to find if he Google searches your name.

- If you didn't find your answer this way, feel free to ask me or your fellow students for help!
- You can reach me on Slack (@seancahall) or via email (sean@origincodeacademy.com).

Let's do this!

Cheers,
